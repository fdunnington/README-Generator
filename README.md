  ### Depoloyed at https://fdunnington.github.io/README-Generator

  ## Description:

  #### Motivation #### 
  This project was an execrise in learning how to use node, npm, and markdown.
  The app is aimed to make creating a README an easy process, using node prompts to create the structure of the README, and the prompt answers to complete the detail of the README.


  #### Learnings #### 
  The project taught me not only about node and npm, and how they can be used to make processes more efficient, but also helped me develop a better understanding of Markdown, enabling me to create a clear and user-friendly instruction manual for my Github repos. This README was created with the generator.
